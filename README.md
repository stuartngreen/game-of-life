# game-of-life
Attempts at implementing [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Attempts

1. **[C++]** I had no knowledge of design patterns or anything at this stage. I used the CodeBlocks IDE with the GNU GCC compiler. It's very basic and runs in the console. Hopefully my next attempt will be better!

2. **[TypeScript]** A version in TypeScript that starts with a random grid and allows some user control while running in the browser.
You can see it in action [here](https://stuartngreen.github.io/game-of-life/typescript/).

3. **[Angular]** Coming soon!
